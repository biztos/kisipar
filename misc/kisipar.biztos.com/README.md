# README: kisipar.biztos.com

The plan:

* kisipar.biztos.com for user-centric overview.
* github.com for the technical rundown.
* godoc.org for the API documentation.
* freebie test runners etc.

I *ultimately* want the main binary to be self-documenting, i.e. if you run
it with no other args then you get a site with the documentation running
locally.

It would be nice to have that at `kisipar.biztos.com` but there is the problem
of DNS for `biztos.com` -- so it may turn out that the biztos site is just for
an overview and links to the latest real thing running somewhere else.
