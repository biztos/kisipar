# README: kisipar built-in templates.

The built-in templates are organized in "theme" directories.  Only those
items in the theme directory should be loaded into a given template set.

Built-in templates most not assume anything about static assets; styles
and scripts must be built in.

The goal is to provide reasonably useful defaults for these use cases:

1. Running a blog (or similar) without any custom templates.
2. Debugging content.
3. Debugging kisipar itself.
