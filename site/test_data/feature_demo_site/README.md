# README: Kisipar Feature Demo Site

*Note: this file, `README.md`, will be ignored by Kisipar.*

## Purpose

Demonstrate as many features as possible in a live site, without worrying
much about *documentation.*

That is, you find yourself in the developer's sandbox.  Anything might happen,
and the unit-testing code will not make any assumptions about the contents of
the `feature_demo_site` directory.

There will be a "proper" demo site built into the application at some point,
but that will of course be virtual.  Things from this sandbox may migrate to
that demo, and possibly even into the default templates.

## Launch

From the main project directory:

    go run kisipar.go test_data/feature_demo_site

(Probably.)
