# KISIPAR NOTES -- mainly to myself!

## Layout

Use "lots of files in package" as that seems to be the norm.

Try to reduce the code footprint!


## Generations

Bindoc I think in any case, right?

If we end up with enums:

## DS Interaction


    if !ds.Has(rpath) {
        // Send 404 etc.
    }
    // We now have either a Page or a File or (maybe) raw data.
    if page, err := ds.Page(rpath); err == nil {
        // Serve Page
    }
    if page := ds.Page(have-page) {
        ..serve-page..
    } else {
        ... get it as a file or what?
    }
